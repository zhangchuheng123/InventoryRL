## Instruction for Section 7.4

The main results can be collected by running ``bash train.sh``. The specific instructions are as follows:

- The results of our algorithm in Table 4 and Figure 6 are generated by running ``sac_discrete.py`` using the config file ``default.yaml`` with keywords ``num_product`` and ``target_budget_discount`` modified as the number of product N and average threshold q/N correspondingly.
- The results of benchmark algorithms in Table 4 are generated by running ``classical.py`` using the config file ``default.yaml``.
- The results of Figure 7 are generated by running ``additional_experiment_sample_cost.py``.
- The results of Table 5 are generated by running ``additional_experiment_network.py``.
- The results of Figure 9 are generated by running ``additional_experiment_subgradient.py``.

All programs will generate results and log the results in Weights & Biases ([https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/)) as well as TensorBoard. The results in tables can be read from these sources accordingly. The figures are plotted using matplotlib ([https://matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/)) based on the data downloaded from these sources.
